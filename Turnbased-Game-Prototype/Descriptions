📘 Project 1: TurnBased-Game-Simulation.cpp

🔍 Description
This project is a simulation of a turn-based strategy game featuring warriors on a 2D grid. Each warrior can move, fight, and shoot in multiple directions based on commands provided. The simulation handles input, action parsing, direction validation, and game logic like health tracking and player interaction.


🎯 What I Learned
- Enums & Constants: Used enumerations and constants to manage game logic clearly.
- 2D Arrays: Learned map representation and manipulation.
- Function Design: Practiced breaking down large functionality into modular functions.
- Game Simulation Logic: Implemented combat mechanics, collision detection, and boundary checking.
